# Project: Activity 3 - Web Game Scaffolding

## Overview
This project appears to be a web-based game or interactive application currently in the initialization phase. While the directory structure and media assets are in place, the core source files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `src/index.js`) are currently empty (0 bytes). The presence of character, map, and monster assets suggests a 2D RPG or arcade-style game.

## Directory Structure

### `assets/`
Contains the graphical assets for the game:
- **Characters:** `bear.png`, `chara1.png`, `chara2.png`
- **Environment:** `map0.png`, `map1.png`, `map2.png`, `space3.png`, `img_lamp.jpg`
- **UI/Items:** `heart.png`, `pad.png`
- **Monsters:** Animated GIFs (`monster/` directory) for various enemies.

### `src/`
- **`index.js`**: Intended to be the main entry point for the application's logic. Currently empty.

### Root Files
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML document. Currently empty.
- **`style.css`**: The main stylesheet. Currently empty.

## Getting Started

Since the source files are empty, the immediate tasks for development are:

1.  **HTML Setup:** Create a standard HTML5 boilerplate in `index.html`, linking `style.css` and importing `src/index.js`.
2.  **Asset Loading:** Implement logic in `src/index.js` to load and render the images found in `assets/`.
3.  **Game Loop:** Establish a basic game loop or event handling system to interact with the assets.

## Development Notes
- **Tech Stack:** Vanilla HTML Canvas/CSS/JavaScript(inferred from file structure).
- **Environment:** No build system (e.g., webpack/vite) is currently visible, suggesting a simple static file approach or a need to initialize a package manager if dependencies are required later.
